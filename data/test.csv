Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone.

I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume.

It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3"" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say ""don't buy this"", but I would be forewarned.

As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.","Doesn't actually do any air ""cleaning""",en,home

This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip.

But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them.

Fakespot.com gives it a ranking of D, which means it is very likely that there are a lot of fake good reviews here. Pro: The robot is a new category of toy, or you can even call it a pet. It go explore by itself and it does not require a phone to do so. It wakes up in the morning and wanders around and makes cute noise. It greets you when you get home (you have to make sure that he hears you and sees your face though). In summary, being autonomous is a major pro that you can't see from other products. Cons: 1: too slow in processing your command. I think the chip is from 2015. So can't expect too much in terms of processing speed. Also you can't expect it to be that smart because of this. 2. Edge detection is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Sometimes it just runs at full speed and falls directly off the edge. The worst part is that sometimes when it's right on the edge, it misunderstands to be on air. This causes it to act irritated and shake its arms and fall off. I don't think this is merely a problem of software. 3. It gets boring. Soon you'll realize its movements and responses are just algorithms and predictable. You get bored of it after no longer than a week. A toy is just a toy at the end. You don't want to spend $250 and eventually forget about it. In summery. It is a new and interesting experience to have a robot like this. But it is still very limited and you get bored of it very quickly. If you have extra money and really want the new experience, just get it.

The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it! So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!! You won't be disappointed!",Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :(,en,jewelry

Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.",Ok case with serious limitations,en,pc

The high-top design of the opening not only keeps my ankles warm, it also keeps the slippers from coming off easily -- and from shopping around, this seems like a pretty unique feature. The slippers are very well-padded and feel very snug on the foot (although most of the padding is actually on top of the foot; there's not much padding on the sole, so if you're walking in these a lot, it will probably flatten.) All of these aspects make me really want to love these slippers. BUT I'm so let down by the fabrication. They seem to have focused entirely on the exterior of the slipper and ignored the interior. I want these to keep my feet cozy. But the interior fabric is not very soft, and doesn't feel good on my feet. Even worse, there is an exposed seam running around the interior of the slipper -- i.e. the fabric is sewn together, and the two ends are not tucked behind the seam, but extrude into the interior of the slipper and poke into my feet. Basically, every time I wear these I want to put on socks, to make my feet more comfortable -- but if I'm already going to put socks on, I don't really need the slippers, so...

en_0483721,product_en_0294766,reviewer_en_0560047,3,"3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.",Loved Collins...

The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I'll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot?

As far as accomplishing that task, it is wonderful. Now to the nitty gritty. The bike comes with a Shimano rear derailleur, which works well as you would expect from a known reliable manufacturer. However, both of the shifters and the front derailleur are cheap aftermarket brand and NOT Shimano, despite how it is described. The shifters are loose between each gear stage, and too stiff to shift up to higher gears in some cases. The front derailleur is very difficult to adjust because of its cheap make, and the metal it is made out of is also very cheap and the whole derailer became unusable after spending some time just trying to get it adjusted. The seat pole is too long and interferes with the frame suspension, but that can be easily solved by cutting off a few inches of the pole. Basically, if you're someone who knows a lot about bicycles and how they work, this is a great bicycle frame with a unique design that can be very useful, but out of the package it immediately will need a few modifications and new front derailleur and new shifters if you plan to use this for serious riding.",Great frame but the rest of the bike parts made cheaply,en,other

My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys.

en_0522818,product_en_0252195,reviewer_en_0787180,4,"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",Cool concept!

I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign.

Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that‚Äôs right RUST. Perhaps it‚Äôs from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for.

The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn‚Äôt shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars.

Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently.","Remember, it's a chipper",en,lawn_and_garden

I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is.

Overall the controller works great - good ergonomics, buttons are satisfying, sticks are usable, gyro seems to work, low latency. My only complaints : 1) the rumble is really, really extreme. So much rumble. Some kind of setting to turn it down would be great. 2) the binding procedure was a little weird, but well-explained in the (marginally) translated instructions.

No signs of wear along the band or around the buckle. Very happy. ~~~~~ Original review: I bought the Silver Swirls pattern-- the one with the spirals & I wear it all the time, including workouts. I've had it only for a week, but so far am very happy with it. The pictures accurately show the color & pattern. The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back, so it doesn't look like something that's just stamped on the outside. A week is too short to know, but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading. I'm not about to scrape it to find out, but may update the review later.

He sees Zane's standoffish behavior and knows that he's struggling with something painful. Sebastian offers a listening ear, friendship, and comfort. Zane is stewing in grief and there are moments when it overwhelms him. Sebastian shows up every time, just being a quiet presence. It was wonderful to watch these two so quickly fall, they take a bit to acknowledge their feelings. Lovely ending.",Sebastian and Zane,en,digital_ebook_purchase
